This is a small meal Tracker React Native project where I recreated a screen from a Figma design. The idea was to practice turning a design into working code, with a focus on clean layout, responsiveness, and readable code. Also to learn about how mobile development works.

Tried to keep components small and reusable

Matched the Figma layout as closely as possible

Built with responsiveness in mind so it look
